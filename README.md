# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Optimization Using Quantum Annealing

## Project Overview
This project explores solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, using quantum annealing. The aim is to leverage QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulations and compare quantum annealing's performance with classical methods such as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and backtracking. 

The notebook contains all the implementation details, analysis, and results.
